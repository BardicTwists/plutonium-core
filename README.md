# Plutonium: It's like Rails, but for Rails!

[![Ruby](https://github.com/radioactive-labs/plutonium-core/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radioactive-labs/plutonium-core/actions/workflows/main.yml)

**Plutonium** is a powerful Rapid Application Development (RAD) toolkit for Rails that picks up where Rails left off, introducing application-level concepts and tooling that transform the way you build applications.

## Overview

Plutonium builds upon Rails' conventions and extends them with:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Integrates seamlessly with Rodauth or your existing auth system
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Rich fields, forms, tables, and nested resources out of the box
- **Modular Architecture**: Package system based on Rails engines for better organization
- **Entity Scoping**: Built-in multi-tenancy support that "just works"
- **Smart Generators**: Eliminate boilerplate while maintaining flexibility
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface powered by Tailwind CSS and Hotwire

## Project Status

> [!WARNING]
> While Plutonium is actively used in production environments, it's still in early development. APIs may change, and some features are still evolving. We recommend thoroughly testing before deploying to production.
